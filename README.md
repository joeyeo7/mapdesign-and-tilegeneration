# Seattle Area Maps Project

For this project, I created a map to showcase four different tile sets represented within Seattle and its surrounding areas at a minimum zoom level of 1 and a maximum zoom level of 12. These visualizations help to put into perspective how different themes can be implemented to produce different information even if it's in the same place.

## Base Map (Grey and Blue)

The base map features a custom grey and blue color scheme that I thought looked nice and provided a clean, modern aesthetic. This map serves as the foundation for the other thematic layers, providing geographical context with a visually appealing design.

## Public Schools in Seattle

This map highlights the locations of public schools within the Seattle area, represented by dots. It's designed to offer insight into the distribution of educational institutions across the city, making it a valuable resource for understanding Seattle's educational geography.

## Combined Map (Base + Public Schools)

Combining the base map with the public schools data, this visualization layers the educational points of interest over the geographical context provided by the custom base map. It illustrates how thematic data can be integrated with a base map to enhance the map's informational value.

## Arsenal Map (Red and White)

As a huge Arsenal fan, I created a map themed around Arsenal's colors, red and white. This map is a personal tribute to the team and showcases how map design can be tailored to represent specific interests or affiliations, even within the context of geographic visualization.

## About This Project

This project was an exploration of geographic phenomena within Seattle, employing Mapbox and custom tilesets to visualize diverse themes ranging from educational geography to personal interests. Each map is designed with a specific focus, demonstrating the versatility and potential of GIS and web mapping technologies to convey information in unique and meaningful ways.

Thank you for exploring my Seattle Area Maps Project!
